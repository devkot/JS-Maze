JavaScript Maze game developed at University of Nice during my Erasmus semester.
Uses HTML 5, CSS and JS.

The game is a virtualization of the typical maze board game with moving tiles.

The functionality is supported by JS and the graphics are done with CSS and the icons are taken from Font Awesome website.
There are 4 players and the point of the game is to get to the trophy in the middle. There is a scoreboard counting the victories of each player.
The game supports drag and drop, JSON save game and allows the user to change the board size.
